Version 2.0
-----------
Complete rewrite. This backwards incompatible due to the following changes:
    * Move from source-only distribution to library-based API.
    * API is c-based to simplify wrappers to other languages.
    * Namespaced macros and functions to prevent clashes and undefined behavior.

Version 1.0
-----------
Source-only distribution. Supports C, C++, and FORTRAN. Exports to CSV and Eiger.
