The Lightweight Performance Instrumentation Library (lwperf) is a tool to add
instrumentation to your applications. Simple API calls allow for adding metrics
of interest, starting, and stopping instrumentation. lwperf supports exporting
the data to CSV, Eiger, and SST/macro, and can be used to collect both
execution time and hardware performance counters using PAPI.

* Documentation:
This code is documented in the doc subdirectory. Run 'make' to regenerate
(requires pdflatex).

* Build:
To build using the defaults, run
    ./configure
    make
Support for PAPI, Eiger, and SST/macro need to be enabled explicitly during
configuration with --enable-papi, --enable-eiger, and --enable-sstmac
respectively.

* Install:
After building, run 'make install'.

* Requirements:
See lwperf.pdf. Support for PAPI, Eiger, and SST/macro require each to be
installed, but are not mandatory.

* Parallelism:
The library is thread safe assuming no lwperf_t pointers are shared between
threads.

* Papi: Hardware Performance Counters:
This build supports the collection of PAPI hardware performance counters during
execution in addition to excution time. This allows for the creation of other
performance metrics, such as power or energy. Support must be explicitly
configured and PAPI must be explicitly initialized during runtime.
