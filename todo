* some sort of reporting so if you call init_rapl but there's no rapl support, it allerts you
* maybe a pkg-config thing: need to handle optional features (papi, eiger, sstmac) and their flags
    this gets complicated if those libs don't provide pc files
* better way to notify that papi was not installed if someone tries to use it
* fortran api on top of c api
* c++ api on top of c api


Add in timer so we can handle overflow.
    Necessary? Are any compute regions greater than ~60 secs?
    Would need to set up and tear down per region. Maybe just print out a
    warning if the end time is greater than some threshold, indicating that it
    should be re-run with overflow handling turned on.
        Add a compilation flag that turns on overflow handling.
