Add in timer so we can handle overflow.
    Necessary? Are any compute regions greater than ~60 secs?
    Would need to set up and tear down per region. Maybe just print out a
    warning if the end time is greater than some threshold, indicating that it
    should be re-run with overflow handling turned on.
        Add a compilation flag that turns on overflow handling.
